        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>I grew up in Trinidad and Tobago, spent 4 years teaching Mathematics in Grenada, and lived in New York for about 15 years (on and off). I served in the Navy Reserves for 7 years, in a group called the Seabees. I enjoy giving back to young people, and during the past 3 years I have worked with organizations like Girls Who Code and New York On Tech to help underrepresented teens learn the fundamentals of coding. I hope to find a similar organization to work with here in Seattle. As a new resident of Seattle, I hope to take advantage of the outdoor activities and explore what the rest of the West Coast has to offer.</p>

      <div id="education">
        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>I am not afraid to learn new things, and consider myself a life long learner. I was inpsired by my uncle at an early age, because he had learning disabilities as a child that prevented him from going to school. As an adult, he enrolled in classes to complete his high school leaving certificate (equivalent to a GED in the US). I always remembered his determination and try to go after things that I am interested in. At one point in time, I even signed up to learn accounting, which I discovered quickly that I had little interest in.</p>
        
        <p>My education includes obtaining a Bachelors degree in Mathematics, and additional course work in various schools and programs in Statistics, Web Development, Database Management, and Java Development, as well as Computer Science.</p>
